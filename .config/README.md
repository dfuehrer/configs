# configs
- this is just a bunch of my configs that I've made
    - this isn't everything but a lot of the stuff I've messed with
- I'll probably add to this later as I add configs, maybe even add things that are more auto-generated
### notes
- i should have more, maybe ill put some later
- the .bashrc in the home dir is hardlinked to by .config/bash/bashrc so it shows up as 2 files but they are automatically linked on my computer
